# 📈 AI-Powered Sales Forecasting Dashboard

This project focuses on predicting future sales trends for a retail business using Machine Learning and interactive Data Visualization.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Using the **Sample Superstore dataset**, I developed a time-series forecasting model to predict monthly sales. The project bridge the gap between complex data science (Python) and business-friendly reporting (Power BI).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Forecasting Library:** FB Prophet
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visuals:** Power BI Desktop & Plotly
- **Environment:** Google Colab

## 📊 Model Performance Metrics
The model was evaluated based on 4 years of historical data with the following results:
- **Accuracy:** 88.50%
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 5,203.24
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 6,762.71
- **Forecast Period:** 12 Months

## 📂 Key Features
- **Dynamic KPIs:** Real-time summary of Total, Average, Min, and Max Predicted Sales.
- **Trend Analysis:** Visual representation of predicted sales (`yhat`) across 2018.
- **Interactive Slicers:** Filter data by Year and Month for deep-dive analysis.
- **AI-Driven Insights:** Automated identification of seasonal sales peaks.
